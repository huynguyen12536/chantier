# Consolidation design basis

**Terminology:** **Current Verified Legacy (CVL)** is the reverse-engineered workspace evidence; **Pending Legacy Discovery** has no asserted facts; the **Unified Platform** is the target.

**Boundary:** Documentation/planning only. The frontend is frozen: its Supabase RPC, Edge, table, auth, and realtime interaction patterns are compatibility requirements for future backend adapters. This material changes no frontend, CVL rule, production environment, database, or business module.

**Evidence:** `migration-analysis/business-flows.md` (flows A–G), `migration-analysis/merge/fe_contract_matrix.md`, `migration-analysis/merge/MERGE_DECISION_MATRIX.md`, Phase 4–8 design packs, and Decision O3.

# Unified Platform data migration plan

This is an ETL and reconciliation design for CVL dumps. It does not read, transform, import, or alter production data. Pending Legacy Discovery remains an intake lane requiring provenance, mapping, and an explicit merge decision before any data is included.
